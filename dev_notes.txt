Project URLs are standardized with commmon.standardize_project_url

REDIS database structure is below.

RAC:MAG ratios:
standardized_url'_rac_mag_ratio':str

Required credits: (dict stored as json)
standardized_url+'_required_credits':str

Banned users from specific projects:
banned_uids_standardized_url={uid1:str,uid2:str...}

Banned CPIDs across all projects:
banned_cpids={cpid1:str,cpid2:str,etc}

User lookup table. Note that UIDs with RAC <1 don't appear here.
uid_table_standardizedurl={'uid1':User,'uid2':User...}
User object is just a dict which has been encoded to a JSON string. So to read it from redis, we need to decode it. The dict has the following structure:
{
cpid:str=cpid,
expavg_credit:str=expavg_credit (RAC, floating value)
create_time:str=create_time (UNIX epoch time)
total_credit:str=total_credit
}

Single vars we track:
# of times faucet has sent out a tx
total_dispensed:float
# total value of those txes
total_grc_dispensed:float
